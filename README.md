Our gathering of the census data is broken up into each region.
Each file collects the data for that region and outputs it as a csv file. They are broken up into the following regions.

Northeast (Malika)
Southeast (Chad)
Midwest (Will)
Southwest (Alice)
West (Jonathan)

The nationwide.pynb jupyter notebook file collects the outputs and merges them into one dataframe.
Our analysis of the data into graphs takes place in that file.

Our final conclusions are summarized in the CensusProjectConclusion.docx file.
